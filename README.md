# Fire_freq_pred_modelling 
Use of a species distribution modelling workflow to produce a predictive model for fire frequency from satellite derived fire products and governmentally produced fire history data. 

This project aimed to determine whether we could produce a predictive model of fire frequency for satellite derived fire products using a species distribution modelling workflow with governmentally produced fire data and gridded environmental data as predictor variables.
