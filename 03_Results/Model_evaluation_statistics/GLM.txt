Generalised linear model for predicting fire frequency in South east Queensland using a Boosted regression tree. The following information provides details on model parameters and evluation metrics.
Model = glm
Model = Sentinel_ff ~ QPWS_ff + TWI + Temp_season + Precip_season + Diurnal_temp + FPC + Soil_clay + Slope + Aspect + TPI + Elevation
Model = poisson
Model = Pres_back[trainSet, ]
Model = ifelse(Pres_back[trainSet, 13] == 1, 1, prNum/bgNum)
The following model evaluation measures were calculated using precrec::evalmod(), by including mode = 'basic' this returns further measures beyond AUC ROC and precision-recall curves.
Area Under the Reciever Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC ROC)  =  0.668
Precision-Recall curve (PRC) =  0.668
Classification error rate =  0.416
Accuracy =  0.584
Precision =  0.651
Specificity (TNR) =  0.584
Sensitivity (TPR) =  0.583
F-score, a balanced measure of model performance based on precision and recall =  0.544
Matthews correlation coefficient =  0.198
Mean squared error = 1.737
R-squared = -0.273
Deviance of observed and predicted values = 1.402
